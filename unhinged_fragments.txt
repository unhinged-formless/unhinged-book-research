Jim Palmer - Unhinged

It's unfortunate that term 'unhinged' has mostly a negative connotation. We would all do well to become unhinged every now and again. As a verb, 'unhinged' is defined as: 'to be disturbed in mind, made uneasy, or cause to be worried or alarmed.' At times we need...

Friedrich Nietzsche

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was a German philosopher. He began his career as a classical philologist, turning to philosophy early in his academic career. In 1869, aged 24, Nietzsche became the youngest professor to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel. Plagued by health problems for most of his life, he resigned from the university in 1879, and in the following decade he completed much of his core writing. In 1889, aged 44, he suffered a collapse and thereafter a complete loss of his mental faculties, with paralysis and vascular dementia, living his remaining 11 years under the care of his family until his death. His works and his philosophy have fostered not only extensive scholarship but also much popular interest.

Absurdism

Absurdism is a philosophical theory that the universe is irrational and meaningless. It states that trying to find meaning leads people into conflict with a seemingly meaningless world. This conflict can be between rational humanity and an irrational universe, between intention and outcome, or between subjective assessment and objective worth, but the precise definition of the term is disputed. Absurdism claims that, due to one or more of these conflicts, existence as a whole is absurd. It differs in this regard from the less global thesis that some particular situations, persons, or phases in life are absurd.

Terence McKenna

Terence Kemp McKenna was an American philosopher, ethnobotanist, lecturer, and author who advocated for the responsible use of naturally occurring psychedelic plants and mushrooms. He spoke and wrote about a variety of subjects, including psychedelic drugs, plant-based entheogens, shamanism, metaphysics, alchemy, language, philosophy, culture, technology, ethnomycology, environmentalism, and the theoretical origins of human consciousness. He was called 'Timothy Leary of the '90s', 'one of the leading authorities on the ontological foundations of shamanism', and 'the intellectual voice of rave culture'. The critical reception of Terence McKenna's work was deeply polarized, with critics accusing him of promoting dangerous ideas and questioning his sanity, while others praised his writing as groundbreaking, humorous, and intellectually provocative.

Joker (character)

The Joker is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson, the character first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman on April 25, 1940. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for his design while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.

[THEMES: divine madness, philosophy, religion, mysticism, unhinged, transcendence]
Divine Madness (Wikipedia)

Divine madness, also known as theia mania and crazy wisdom, is unconventional, outrageous, unexpected, or unpredictable behavior linked to religious or spiritual pursuits. Examples of divine madness can be found in Buddhism, Christianity, Hellenism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Shamanism. It is usually explained as a manifestation of enlightened behavior by persons who have transcended societal norms, or as a means of spiritual practice or teaching among mendicants and teachers. These behaviors may seem to be symptoms of mental illness, but could also be manifestations of religious ecstasy or even be 'strategic, purposeful activity' by highly self-aware individuals making strategic use of the theme of madness in the construction of their public personas.

Plato's Four Types of Divine Madness (Phaedrus)

In his dialogue Phaedrus, Socrates argues that madness is not necessarily an evil, claiming that 'the greatest of blessings come to us through madness, when it is sent as a gift of the gods.' He describes four types of divine madness: the prophetic frenzy of the Oracle of Delphi (the gift of Apollo), mystical revelations and initiations which provide 'a way of release for those in need' (the gift of Dionysus), poetic inspiration (the gift of the Muses), and the madness of lovers (the gift of Aphrodite and Eros). Each represents a god-sent opening beyond ordinary perception.

Biblical Prophets: God-Commanded Madness

The Old Testament prophets displayed bizarre behavior that by today's secular standards would be considered insanity—but these actions were COMMANDED BY GOD as symbolic acts conveying divine messages. Isaiah stripped naked and wandered around (Isaiah 20). Jeremiah hid his underwear in a rock, retrieved it after a 'long time,' and wore a cattle yoke (Jeremiah 13, 27-28). Ezekiel ate a scroll, was rendered mute, lay on his side for 390 days drawing Jerusalem under siege, ate barley cakes baked over cow manure, shaved his beard with a sword dividing his hairs into thirds which he burned, scattered, and stabbed (Ezekiel 1-5). Hosea married a prostitute and named their daughter Lo-ruhama, meaning 'unloved' (Hosea 1). These men were not prophets in spite of their eccentricities—their actions were at the center of their ministry.

Prophetic Character: Divine Madness

'There is a divine madness: this marks the Old Testament prophets. This is uncomfortable to have beside the way we operate' (Ian Breward). The biblical prophets don't fit in easily like other people; they often seem to be off on a tangent, worrying about something that most people don't care about. The prophet is often out of step with the mood of the times. They often seem to be misfits. A prophet always stands in danger of being thought insane. He does not see what other men see. He has the strangest kind of intuitive grasp of things. It seems as if fresh from heaven he is astounded by the carnality of men.

Abraham Heschel on Prophetic Spirit

Abraham Heschel describes the prophet as an 'unbearable extremist' who 'disdains those for whom God's presence is comfort and security; to him it is a challenge, an incessant demand.' To a person endowed with prophetic insight, everyone else appears blind; to a person whose ear perceives God's voice, everyone else appears deaf. 'The prophet hates the approximate, he shuns the middle of the road. Man must live on the summit to avoid the abyss. There is nothing to hold to except God.' The prophet's word is 'a scream in the night. While the world is at ease and asleep, the prophet feels the blast from heaven.'
