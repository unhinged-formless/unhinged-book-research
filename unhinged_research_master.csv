47,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Raoul Duke's Destructive Unhinged,Destructive Chaos,Nihilism|Absurdism|Drug-induced Chaos|Recoil from Void|American Dream Collapse,"Raoul Duke, Hunter S. Thompson's alter ego in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,' embodies the destructive chaos branch of the 'unhinged' concept through his drug-induced descent into madness as a recoil from meaninglessness. His journey to Las Vegas to chase the American Dream becomes a nihilistic spiral where every attempt to find purpose or truth is met with absurdity and chemical-induced distortion. Duke's behavior represents not liberation but destructive chaos—a violent rejection of societal norms that stems from recognizing the void at the heart of American culture post-1960s counterculture collapse. The novel connects deeply with nihilism and absurdism through Duke's trajectory. His drug-induced haze serves as both escape from and confrontation with meaninglessness. Key scenes like hallucinating giant bats in the desert, being kicked out of shows for disruptive behavior, and huffing ether in hotel rooms exemplify this destructive unhinged trajectory. The famous 'wave speech' captures this philosophical underpinning: Duke describes the 1960s as 'a very special time and place to be a part of... with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.' Duke's response is not to rebuild but to embrace the wreckage through increasingly destructive behavior, making him a perfect embodiment of destructive unhingedness as recoil from the void.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas|https://web.archive.org/web/20110307015848/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/03/the_american_dr.php#more,2026-01-06,Initial
