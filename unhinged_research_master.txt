## Daily Summary - 2026-01-05

This database contains 46 entries exploring "unhinged" across philosophy, literature, cinema, religion, and mysticism. Core understanding: Unhinged as threshold where reality's hinges break open, leading to two trajectories—destructive chaos (recoil from void: Joker, nihilism) or constructive liberation (embrace of opening: Camus, mystics, Mila). The hinge itself is not negative; what matters is what one meets in the opening.
